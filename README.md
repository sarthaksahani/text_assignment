# Title - Image Classification with CNN using keras and Tensorflow2

## Prerequisites :

This project assumes that you are familiar with the basic concepts and theory of Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) and Image Processing.

* In case, you dont have good understanding about CNNs, you can check out the following link to get some knowledge about CNNs:

# Overview of the Dataset:

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. 
- There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.

The dataset is divided into five training batches and one test batch, each with 10000 images. 
* The test batch contains exactly 1000 randomly-selected images from each class. 
* The training batches contain the remaining images in random order, but some training batches may contain more images from one class than another. 
* Between them, the training batches contain exactly 5000 images from each class.

# Platform
 Used google Collab for this task

# Python Libraries
 1-NumPy -For Dealing with matrix and arrays 

 2-Pandas-for dealing with dataframe

 3-Matplotlib-for visualization

 4-Seaborn-for visualization

 & Keras, Tensorflow2.0 -for model building, Training and Testing


## This project is divided into the following 5 Stages and the model is build in 3 parts :


### 3 PARTS OF THE MODEL:

* TOP Part : Convolutional Layers
* MIDDLE Part : Flatten Layer
* BOTTOM Part : Dense Layers



### 6 STAGES OF MODEL_BUILDING IN THIS PROJECT: [Steps Involved]

1. Importing libraries and Understanding the data.

2. Preprocessing of Data

3. Creating the Convolution model

4. Training the model.

5. Testing and evaluating Model

6. Improving the performance.

 
# Result
  In this assignment, I have successfully classified CiFar10 dataset which comprise of ten different object images.
